#What is pboy?
My own version of a gameboy (DMG) emulator
with experimental dgb stub

#Design background
Idea of the project is to learn and understand how a simple CPU works.
First step was to get some if the instructions working.
I used a test framework called gbit to do so.
I wanted to understand how remote debugging can be implemented.

#Dev status
All individidual instructions are pass (according to gbit)
Some basic blargg testroms are pass
blarggs instruction test are fail (due to timer)
I have added a very basic implementation of a gdb stub for my emulator.

#TODO
Timer implementation
Display
Rom banking
